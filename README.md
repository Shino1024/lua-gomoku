<font size="20">Some small thing, written in Lua in order to exercise - the Gomoku game.</font>
<br>
<font size="16">
It's a mini-game which follows the renji rules. There are many helper functions of which this game
consists. At first, there will be a possibility to play in the text mode. Perhaps
I will add the graphical user interface in the future for a convenient play.
<br>
This game is my first project in Lua and it can contain errors, as well as some bugs. Feel free to
fork it and make your own changes. I don't think that it'll be possible to play with a computer.
