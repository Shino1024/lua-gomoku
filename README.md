<font size="20">Some small thing, written in Lua in order to exercise - the Gomoku game.</font>
<br>
<font size="16">
It's a mini-game which follows the renji rules. There are many helper functions of which this game
consists. At first, there will be a possibility to play in the text mode. Perhaps in the future
I will add the graphical user interface for a convenient play.
